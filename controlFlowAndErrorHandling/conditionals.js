? ELSE IF

-If the first if statement is not met or true it moves to the first else if

anymore else if's or else
-Have to use `` with ${} placeholders. pretty conveinent to avoid using the + then variable name and so on
-Use the placeholders if putting variables in strings because it will be compilied faster than concatenation
