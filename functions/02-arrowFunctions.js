! Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions are expressional functions that can be simplified into one of two forms, CONCISE and BLOCK BODY. The main
  goal is to generate shorter syntax for writing a function. 

* Arrow functions also do NOT get hoisted.

  1. Arrow functions are ALWAYS anonymous. Look this up and see what this means. 
  2. Parameters are still capable of being injected.
        - if we only have one parameter, we technically dont need the parans ()
        - But if are not passing any parameters, it is required to denote ()
  3. This syntax tells JS that we are about to process function.
  4. Within this format, JS assumes the return statement.

//* Block:
// The 'return' keyword IS required. We also include the curly braces.
